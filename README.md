## Emmett A. Berger

I am a student at The University of Texas at Austin interested in Psychology. 

I am originally from Boston, MA, but I grew up in Dallas, TX. I am passionate about the technologies of the future, such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering, and how we can harness their powers for good.
